**Arbitrum** has achieved a significant milestone with its total value locked (TVL) surpassing **$18 billion**, representing a remarkable 23% increase over the past two weeks. This surge positions the Layer 2 network as a major force in the evolving DeFi landscape.

## AI-Powered Protocols Lead the Charge

The growth is primarily driven by the rapid adoption of **AI-integrated DeFi protocols** and institutional embrace of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. AI-powered yield optimization protocols have collectively attracted over **$2.8 billion** in deposits since their December launch.

Three standout protocols are reshaping the ecosystem:

- **Vertex Protocol**: Accumulated $650 million TVL in just three weeks using machine learning for automated market making
- **Radiant Capital**: Reached $480 million with AI-powered lending pools offering dynamic interest rates
- **GMX**: Continues leading with $1.2 billion TVL, followed by Camelot DEX at $890 million

## Institutional RWA Adoption Accelerates

The institutional adoption wave has been equally impressive. **BlackRock's tokenized treasury fund BUIDL** deployed $340 million worth of assets on Arbitrum through Ondo Finance's infrastructure, marking one of the largest institutional RWA deployments on any Layer 2 network.

## Network Metrics Show Strong Growth

Arbitrum's performance metrics reflect this robust adoption:

- **Fee revenue**: $2.1 million over seven days (45% week-over-week increase)
- **Daily active users**: 180,000 users
- **AI protocol share**: 35% of all network transactions

The native **ARB token** has responded positively, gaining 18% over the past week. Major market makers Jump Trading and Wintermute have increased their positions by a combined $23 million.

## Future Outlook

This growth trajectory suggests sustainable expansion driven by genuine utility rather than speculative farming. The convergence of AI technology with traditional DeFi mechanisms addresses critical issues of capital efficiency and risk management, potentially setting new industry standards.

However, the concentration of TVL in newer AI protocols presents potential risks that warrant careful monitoring for overall network stability.
