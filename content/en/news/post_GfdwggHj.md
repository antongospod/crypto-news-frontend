**Ethereum Layer 2 solutions** have reached a historic milestone, with total value locked (TVL) across all L2 networks surpassing **$50 billion** for the first time. This represents a remarkable 340% increase from the beginning of 2024.

## Arbitrum and Base Dominate the Market

**Arbitrum** maintains its leading position with $18.2 billion in TVL, while **Coinbase's Base network** has experienced explosive growth, reaching $12.8 billion to secure its position as the second-largest Layer 2 by locked value. Together, these two networks account for over 60% of the entire L2 ecosystem's liquidity.

According to **L2Beat data**, daily transaction volumes on these networks now regularly exceed Ethereum mainnet activity, reflecting the growing institutional adoption and maturation of L2 infrastructure.

## DeFi Protocols Drive Growth

The surge has been particularly pronounced in the **DeFi sector**, where major protocols have significantly expanded their L2 presence:

- **Uniswap** processes over $2 billion in weekly volume across Layer 2 networks
- **Base** accounts for nearly 40% of Uniswap's L2 activity
- **Aave** and **Curve** have established strong L2 footprints

The lower transaction costs on L2s have enabled new use cases, including micro-transactions and high-frequency trading strategies previously uneconomical on Ethereum mainnet.

## Base's Remarkable Ascent

Base's success can be attributed to Coinbase's strategic positioning and focus on consumer applications. The platform has attracted:

- Over **15 million unique addresses**
- More than **600 decentralized applications**
- An average of **2.5 million daily transactions**

Notable projects like **Friend.tech** and various meme coin ecosystems have contributed significantly to Base's transaction volume.

## Emerging Competition

The L2 landscape is diversifying beyond early leaders. **Polygon's zkEVM** has reached $1.2 billion in TVL, while newer entrants like **Blast** and **Mantle** have collectively attracted over $3 billion in locked assets.

> "The $50 billion TVL milestone represents more than numerical growthâ€”it signals the maturation of Ethereum's scaling roadmap."

This achievement demonstrates that users and capital are embracing L2 solutions at scale, with projections suggesting total L2 TVL could reach **$100 billion by mid-2025**.
