Sure! Please provide the details for your news post in Russian, as you described:

- `title`: The headline of the news post (in Russian)
- `date`: The date (if not specified, I'll use today's date)
- `tag`: The main topic tag (in Russian)
- `img`: The image link
- `description`: A brief summary (in Russian)
- `alt`: Alternative text for the image (in Russian)

Once you provide this info, I’ll:

- Generate a front matter header (шапка) for your post,  
- Translate the title into an English slug following best practices (e.g., lower case, hyphens instead of spaces, only Latin letters),
- Ensure everything matches markdown (md) and frontmatter requirements.

Let me know the details! If you already have the info, just paste it here.
