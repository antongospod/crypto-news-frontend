**Arbitrum** has experienced a remarkable 40% surge in Total Value Locked (TVL) over the past week, reaching $3.2 billion as institutional demand for Real World Assets (RWA) protocols accelerates adoption of the Layer 2 solution.

## Major RWA Protocols Drive Growth

The surge is primarily attributed to the launch of three major RWA protocols on Arbitrum:

- **Centrifuge's credit facilities** attracted $450 million in deposits within 72 hours
- **Goldfinch's expansion** brought $280 million in real estate-backed loans
- **Maple Finance's institutional lending pools** captured $320 million in assets

These protocols collectively account for over 30% of Arbitrum's current TVL, marking a significant departure from traditional DeFi yield farming toward asset-backed financial products.

## Network Performance Metrics

Data from L2Beat shows Arbitrum now processes 65% more daily transactions than **Polygon**, previously the dominant Layer 2 for institutional DeFi applications. The network's average transaction cost has remained stable at $0.15 despite the increased activity.

## Ecosystem Ripple Effects

The institutional influx has created significant growth across Arbitrum's DeFi ecosystem:

- **Camelot DEX** reported a 180% increase in trading volume
- **GMX derivatives platform** saw open interest climb to $89 million
- **Radiant Capital** experienced major inflows as users leverage RWA collateral

## Technical Advantages

Several factors contributed to this concentrated growth on Arbitrum:

The network's recent **Stylus upgrade**, enabling WebAssembly smart contracts, provided RWA protocols with enhanced computational capabilities for complex financial instruments. Additionally, Arbitrum's established relationship with Circle for native USDC support eliminated bridging friction.

## Market Implications

> "This TVL surge could establish Arbitrum as the primary Layer 2 for institutional DeFi applications," analysts suggest.

The RWA sector's expansion reflects broader market trends toward tokenized real-world assets, with BlackRock's recent tokenization initiatives and regulatory clarity from the EU's MiCA framework encouraging traditional financial institutions to explore blockchain-based asset management.

However, the concentration of RWA protocols on a single Layer 2 network introduces systemic risks that warrant monitoring for ecosystem resilience.
